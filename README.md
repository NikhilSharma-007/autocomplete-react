City Search Autocomplete Component
This project features a React-based autocomplete component designed to enhance user experience by providing real-time city suggestions as the user types. Utilizing data fetched from the countriesnow.space API, it offers a dynamic and responsive interface for searching and selecting cities from around the world.

Features
Dynamic City Suggestions: As users type in the search box, a dropdown list of city suggestions appears, updating in real-time based on the input. This list is populated with cities whose names match the current input, whether the match is at the beginning, middle, or end of the city name.
Efficient Data Fetching: City data is fetched once on component mount, minimizing the number of requests and ensuring a smooth user experience.
User-friendly Interface: The component features a clean, intuitive design with a focus on usability. Selected cities are clearly displayed, and suggestions are easily navigable.
Responsive Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS, the component is designed to be visually appealing and functional across a wide range of devices.
